A gameplay element can be categorized as static or as dynamic. 

## Static
Static means that the gameplay part will always stay the same and is not interacting or changing depending on its context. For example having 3 rooms and randomizing them will not result in a verry dynamic system. Shure sometimes one room will be first and another time a diffrent one will be. But the rooms themselve dont change so it is just the order that changes. That makes the experiences inside the room static.

`A + B + C = B + A + C`


> Does not interact with other mechanics 
{: .prompt-info }

## Dynamic
Dynamic means that the gameplay element provides a diffrent experience in a diffrent context or is somehow interacting with other gameplay elements. For example having 3 elements fire, ice, earth, where each element interacts diffrent with eachother. So fire might melt ice but earth might break it. This system is in its base verry simple but the combination of diffrent elements can create something new. Dynamic systems are often more exciting.

`A + B + C != B + A + C`


> Does interact with other mechanics 
{: .prompt-info }

# Conclusion

try to think about the gameplay ements you are implementing. Are they static or dynamic. How could i change a static system to be a dynamic one and get more variety out of it?
