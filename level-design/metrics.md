## Metrics

metrics are the sense of scale, distance, and 
measurements across the level

- Player metrics
(Player size, jump heigt, doge distance etc.)
- Building metrics
(suggestions for floor/wall dimensions etc.)


> Apply metrics and use them as template
for level geometry

## Massing

Massing is the overall feeling and logic 
of shape and space.


- Big masses will feel more important
- Size and heriacy difference makes a 
  place more belivable and interesting
- BMS (Big Medium Small) can be applied
	to the masses


- Does a room feel large and heavy, or 
	low and hidden, or light and open?
- Compare two rooms. Are they close 
	together or far apart? 
- Does one wall seem related to another 
	wall?
